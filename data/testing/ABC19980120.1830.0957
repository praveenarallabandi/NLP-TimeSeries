For his part, Fidel Castro is the ultimate political survivor. People have predicted his demise so many times, and the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions. Time and again, he endures. He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents. Fidel Castro <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">invited John Paul to <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">come for a reason. This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally.

The entire world will <EVENT eid="e15" class="PERCEPTION">see images of the Pope in Cuba. They'll <EVENT eid="e16" class="PERCEPTION">see images of the Pope with Fidel Castro. It will <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation, something the US has, of course, <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_ACTION">tried to <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION">persuade the world that it is not.

For <TIMEX3 tid="t94" type="DURATION" value="P40Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS" temporalFunction="false" functionInDocument="NONE">nearly forty years</TIMEX3>, the United States has <EVENT eid="e26" class="REPORTING">said categorically it would not <EVENT eid="e99" class="I_ACTION">tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard. It is the US economic and political <EVENT eid="e240" class="OCCURRENCE">embargo which has <EVENT eid="e30" class="ASPECTUAL">kept Cuba in a box.

The main positive for Castro to <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE">invite the Pope is international, to be <EVENT eid="e100" class="I_STATE">able to <EVENT eid="e35" class="REPORTING">say to the rest of the world, this government is not as closed, as intolerant, uh as totalitarian as some <EVENT eid="e38" class="I_ACTION">make it out to be.

One of the scenarios widely <EVENT eid="e103" class="REPORTING">advanced before the <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">visit is that through the Pope, Cuba, still <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">led by Castro, can <EVENT eid="e45" class="ASPECTUAL">begin a more productive relationship with the world. That will, in turn, <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">bring pressure on Washington to <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE">change.

Those observers <EVENT eid="e51" class="I_ACTION">looking for a <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE">battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be <EVENT eid="e53" class="STATE">disappointed.

Castro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian. He <EVENT eid="e56" class="REPORTING">says he and the Pope both <EVENT eid="e57" class="I_STATE">want to <EVENT eid="e59" class="ASPECTUAL">end the <EVENT eid="e60" class="OCCURRENCE">exploitation of man by man. The question is who will Cubans <EVENT eid="e378" class="STATE">believe?

The main negative is the risk that the Pope's <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">visit will <EVENT eid="e64" class="I_ACTION">persuade a great many more Cubans to <EVENT eid="e66" class="OCCURRENCE">break loose of the Cuban government. If so, then the Pope's <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">visit would really <EVENT eid="e112" class="ASPECTUAL">open up a new chapter in the government's relations with its own society. For the Cuban government, that is the risk.

At the end of the broadcast <TIMEX3 tid="t1000" type="TIME" value="1998-01-20TEV">this evening</TIMEX3>, one more trip around Havana to see what it's been like since the last time. And in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news.
