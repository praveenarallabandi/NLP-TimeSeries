Live from Atalanta, good evening Lynne Russell, CNN headline news. New evidence is suggesting that a series of bombings in Atalanta and last month</TIMEX3>'s <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">explosion</EVENT> at an Alabama women's clinic might be <EVENT eid="e8" class="STATE">related</EVENT>. Pierre Thomas has the latest.

Atlanta <TIMEX3 tid="t95" type="DATE" value="1996" temporalFunction="false" functionInDocument="NONE">nineteen ninety-six</TIMEX3>. A bomb blast <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE">shocks</EVENT> the Olympic games. One person is <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT>.

<TIMEX3 tid="t96" type="DATE" value="1997-01" temporalFunction="false" functionInDocument="NONE">January nineteen ninety-seven</TIMEX3>. Atlanta again. This time a <EVENT eid="e149" class="OCCURRENCE">bomb</EVENT> at an abortion clinic. More people are <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">hurt</EVENT>. And just <TIMEX3 tid="t97" type="DATE" value="1998-01" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">last month</TIMEX3>, an off duty policeman is <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">killed</EVENT> when a bomb <EVENT eid="e98" class="OCCURRENCE">explodes</EVENT> at another abortion clinic. Location, Birmingham, Alabama.

This man, Eric Rudolph has already been <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE">charged</EVENT> in the Birmingham <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE">bombing</EVENT>. <TIMEX3 tid="t178" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">Now</TIMEX3> officials are <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_ACTION">investigating</EVENT> whether, Rudolph, who remains at large, is <EVENT eid="e27" class="STATE">linked</EVENT> to all three <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE">attacks</EVENT>. The reason, authorities have <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE">discovered</EVENT> tantalizing new evidence.

Steel plates <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE">recovered</EVENT> at the Olympic park bombing <EVENT eid="e34" class="I_STATE">appear</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE">match</EVENT> those <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> at the abortion clinic <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">bombing</EVENT> in Atlanta. Those plates may have <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE">come</EVENT> from a machine shop in north Carolina, where a friend of Rudolph <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE">worked</EVENT>.

And nails <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">found</EVENT> in the Atlanta abortion clinic <EVENT eid="e101" class="OCCURRENCE">bombing</EVENT> are identical to those <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">discovered</EVENT> at Rudolph's storage shed in north Carolina. A senior law enforcement source <EVENT eid="e49" class="REPORTING">tells</EVENT> CNN, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence and it would be extraordinary to <EVENT eid="e53" class="STATE">have</EVENT> all these bits and pieces and there not be a connection.

And law enforcement sources <EVENT eid="e54" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> they can't <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">ignore</EVENT> letters penned under the name army of god. Army of god is a secret organization that hates abortion providers, homosexuals and the US government.

Army of god letters <EVENT eid="e105" class="I_ACTION">claim</EVENT> responsibility for the Atlanta abortion clinic <EVENT eid="e106" class="OCCURRENCE">bombing</EVENT>, a <TIMEX3 tid="t107" type="DATE" value="1997" temporalFunction="false" functionInDocument="NONE">nineteen ninety-seven</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e61" class="OCCURRENCE">attack</EVENT> on a gay lounge and the Birmingham <EVENT eid="e63" class="OCCURRENCE">assault</EVENT>.

An intense <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">manhunt</EVENT> conducted by the FBI and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms <EVENT eid="e66" class="ASPECTUAL">continues</EVENT> for Rudolph in the wilderness of western north Carolina. And <TIMEX3 tid="t108" type="DATE" value="1998-WXX" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">this week</TIMEX3>, FBI director Louie Freeh <EVENT eid="e109" class="OCCURRENCE">assigned</EVENT> more agents to the <EVENT eid="e67" class="OCCURRENCE">search</EVENT>.

Freeh also <EVENT eid="e68" class="I_ACTION">ordered</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">investigation</EVENT> consolidate information under the Atlanta task force, another indication officials <EVENT eid="e72" class="I_STATE">suspect</EVENT> a link between all the <EVENT eid="e73" class="OCCURRENCE">bombings</EVENT>. Privately, authorities <EVENT eid="e74" class="REPORTING">say</EVENT> Rudolph has <EVENT eid="e76" class="OCCURRENCE">become</EVENT> a focus of their <EVENT eid="e77" class="OCCURRENCE">investigation</EVENT>. Publicly, they are <EVENT eid="e111" class="I_STATE">unwilling</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e79" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> any sweeping <EVENT eid="e80" class="OCCURRENCE">assertion</EVENT>. The reason, they <EVENT eid="e82" class="OCCURRENCE">remember</EVENT> Richard Jewell. pierre thomas, CNN, Washington.
